# Meet the Dev Team!

## Purpose

As a Dev Team manager I like to be able to showcase our Team to potential clients. There is also an added benefit that new team members can learn a bit more about the team. This app will ask a manager a series of questions to build a team roster and create a web page of engineers and interns.
